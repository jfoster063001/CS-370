# CS-370

For the Pirate treasure hunt project i was givin some starter code that I built
off of which can be seen as a file in this repository. Computer scientists main job is to find ways to automate thing and to make things as effecient as possible. When I approach a problem I do some research to find out how the problem has tried to been solved and what has worked and see if I can find any new ways that hasent been tried or even try and optimize solutions that are there. I think it is very important to keep the end user in mind with their data and never try to compromise their data.
